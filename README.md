In-house script to pull Nx80 terminal formatted data out of nfcapd-files

NOTE: This is not perfect, especially the createFileName()-part since it plays with hours and minutes to generate a filename with the file-creation lag from nfcapd. I have no idea what happends at 00:00 with that code, but since I use it between 9.00 and 18.00 I dont really care. =)

Use it as you wish, let me know if you do anything useful with it!
